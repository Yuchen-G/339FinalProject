        <h1 id='main'>WHERE DO YOU GET ALL THE ITEMS?</h1>
        <p>Our specialists collect the items both locally & around the world. We authenticate all items before listing
            on our website.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>CAN I RETURN MY ORDER?</h1>
        <p>We DO NOT accept any returns because of the customer’s personal preferences. All sales are final. Please make
            sure before purchase to read the product's description thoughtfully, review images and double-check the
            measurements and condition. Feel free to reach out to us if you need additional information before
            purchasing. We do not accept returns for reasons of the customer’s personal preference. Returns are possible
            only when you have received an item different from the one you ordered. To request a return, refund or
            exchange of a faulty item, please contact us within 2 days after you have received your order.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>HOW DOES SIZING WORK?</h1>
        <p>With most vintage apparel pieces, you CANNOT rely on notification size alone for fit. This is why we include
            measurements on each item's page. Please carefully confirm the measurements of the item prior to purchasing
            since sizing runs unique to each brand, style and year.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other items such as bags and accessories are measured at their widest point. Please note that measurements
            are
            taken by hand, therefore there might be a slight approximation up to 2 cm. If you need more information
            about a
            specific item's sizing, please contact us.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>WHAT PAYMENT METHODS DO YOU ACCEPT?</h1>
        <p>We accept Wechat, Alipay, VISA, PayPal, BOA Zelle, Venmo & Bank Transfer. If you wish to use BANK TRANSFER as
            your payment method, please contact us before you place your order.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>WILL I BE CHARGED ANY DUTIES/TAXES?</h1>
        <p>Any import duties and taxes are charged once the parcel has reached the destination country and those charges
            must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. We are not in charge or in control over those charges as
            customs
            policies vary by country. If you have any questions related to customs charges, we kindly ask you to contact
            your local customs office.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>CAN I CHANGE OR CANCEL MY ORDER?</h1>
        <p>After placing an order, any changes or cancellation cannot be accepted. If the shipping information was
            wrongly
            entered, we will require an handling fee.</p>
